## Configuring YAGPDB

Before downloading Yet Another General Purpose Discord Bot, we need to first configure it. To do this, once again open ~/.profile:

```
nano ~/.profile
```

Then, copy the [env variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb/master/cmd/yagpdb/sampleenvfile) and paste them in.
:::note
You do not have to set each variable. For basic functionality all you need to edit is:

- YAGPDB_CLIENTID - Your Discord Application ID. Found on the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)
- YAGPDB_CLIENTSECRET - Your Discord Application Client Secret. Found on the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)
- YAGPDB_BOTTOKEN - Your Discord Application BOT Token. Found on the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)
- YAGPDB_HOST - The domain of which YAGPDB's panel will be accessible from. Example: `bot.example.com`
- YAGPDB_EMAIL - The email of which your SSL certificate will be assigned to.
- YAGPDB_PQUSERNAME - The username you set when creating your PostGreSQL database user. If following this guide, you most likely set this to 'yagpdb'
- YAGPDB_PQPASSWORD - The password you set when creating your PostGreSQL database user.
- YAGPDB_REDIS - The address for your redis installation. If following this guide, this is most likely set to 'localhost:6379'
:::

Upon pasting the env variables, upon each variable, prefix it with "export". Example:
```
export YAGPDB_OWNER="Insert owner id here"
export YAGPDB_CLIENTID="Insert client id here"
export YAGPDB_CLIENTSECRET="Insert client secret here"
export YAGPDB_BOTTOKEN="Bot token_here"
```

Once you have finished configuring your variables, save the file and then reload the file.
```
source ~/.profile
```

## Downloading YAGPDB

After installing all of the prerequisites, it's time to download and install Yet Another General Purpose Discord Bot.

To download YAGPDB, run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb
cd yagpdb/cmd/yagpdb
sh build.sh
```
This process may take a while, so go grab a cup of tea.

## Running YAGPDB

Finally, To run YAGPDB all you have to do is run:
```
./yagpdb -all
```

:::note
This will run everything that YAGPDB has to offer.  
If you don't have any plugins setup, they will spit out errors.  
Also, this will run bot in ports 5000 and 5001.  
If you want to run it on ports 80 and 443, add flag -pa
:::

This will run YAGPDB as long as your terminal session remains open. If You'd like to keep YAGPDB and close your session, I recommend using nohup. You can learn how to use nohup [here](https://hexadix.com/use-nohup-execute-commands-background-keep-running-exit-shell-promt/)
